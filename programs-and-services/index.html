          Every woman carries great potential. In response to the unique needs
          of women experiencing homelessness we have developed a nine-week
          program with a focus on job-readiness, empowerment, support and
          health. Designed innovative and holistic approach ensures women break
          the cycle of homelessness for themselves, their children, and future
          generations.

                  Our Girls Empowerment program empowers teen girls to achieve
                  their goals and take responsibility for their lives by
                  learning self-directed skills so they can become strong
                  confident young ladies. Girls will learn life skills that
                  often take adults a lifetime to learn. We offer workshops and
                  events for girls in 8th12th grades. Some of the expected
                  results include attitude improvement, improved school
                  performance and grades, better decision-making, improved
                  relationships and conflict resolution, and confidence
                  building.
